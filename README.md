# Implicit-Regularization-in-ReLU-Networks-Paper-code
Matlab Code of  paper "Implicit Regularization in ReLU Networks with the Square Loss"

This paper is by Gal Vardi, Ohad Shamir.
You can find the paper on https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05156

In the paper they used L2 loss, however I added L1 loss, log(cosh) loss and Huber loss to my code.

File plot_Implicit_Regularization.m contains the function.
File Test.m is an example that you could see how it works with different loss functions. Enjoy ;)
